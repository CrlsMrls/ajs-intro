AngularJS Intro
===============

This code was used to introduce Angular JavaScript Framework in the [AngularJS Zürich Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-ZRH/ "Meetup group page"). 

Based on the keynotes, there are 4 steps: 
1. Directives and Data binding
2. View, Controller and Scope
3. Filters
4. Services



Installation
--------------
In order to simulate a _$http_ service, it needs to be run in a web server. To simplify the work there is a little http server that can be runned with node.js

```sh
git clone [git-repo-url] ajs-intro
cd ajs-intro
node lib/node-web-server.js
```

By default it will be running in http://localhost:8000/
